# About

Fatiando a Terra (Portuguese for Slicing the Earth) is an open-source Python
toolkit for modeling and inversion in geophysics. It provides an easy and
flexible way to perform and implement geophysical data analysis.

I've started development of Fatiando in 2010 during my Masters degree at the
Observatório Nacional, Brazil.
I now use it daily for my research and teaching.
Most recent papers published by the [PINGA lab](http://www.pinga-lab.org) use
it in some way.
My [Geophysics courses](/teaching) use Fatiando and
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) to provide students with interactive
examples and synthetic data.

Fatiando was featured in the [89th Boletim SBGf (PDF in
Portuguese)](http://sys2.sbgf.org.br/portal/images/stories/Arquivos/Boletim_89-2014.pdf).

There are also some [slides in Portuguese](/talks/iag-04-2015.html) from a talk
I gave at [USP](http://www.iag.usp.br/) in 2015.

I've given a talk about Fatiando at
[Scipy 2013](http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/)
([read more about it](/talks/scipy2013.html)).
