# About

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

<p>
<em>Tesseroids</em> is a collection of command-line programs for modeling the
gravitational potential, acceleration, and gradient tensor. Tesseroids supports
models and computation grids in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.
</p>
<p>
The geometric element used in the modeling processes is a spherical prism, also
called a tesseroid. Tesseroids also contains programs for modeling using right
rectangular prisms, both in Cartesian and spherical coordinates.
