    Scientists often study entire samples to understand their overall
    properties, but this approach can miss important details. To get a clearer
    picture, researchers are improving methods that focus on smaller regions of
    a sample. In paleomagnetism, a field that studies the Earth's ancient
    magnetic field, magnetic microscopy allows scientists to examine tiny areas
    with high precision. In this study, we use magnetic microscopy data to
    determine the direction of magnetization in samples. To do this, we apply
    a mathematical method called Euler deconvolution, which helps solve complex
    calculations and reduce uncertainty. We also refine our results with an
    additional step that improves accuracy and removes unwanted signals. We
    tested this approach on both simulated and real data. Our results show that
    this new method can detect weaker magnetic sources and accurately determine
    the direction of magnetization. When applied to real samples, it
    successfully identified their original magnetic direction. This represents
    an important step in using magnetic microscopy for paleomagnetic research.

    This is the second contribution from Gelson's PhD thesis. We improved our
    <a href"https://doi.org/10.1029/2023GC011082">original method</a> using an
    iterative scheme to strip the effects of larger dipoles from the signal and
    a non-linear inversion step. The result is that the new method is able to
    cope with much denser distributions of magnetic particles.

    Magmatic rocks record ambient magnetic fields during cooling, preserving them for billions of years through thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). TRM accuracy depends on particle size, shape, magnetic properties, and the number of particles available to record the field. While traditionally interpreted via Neél’s single-domain theory, most particles exist in a vortex state, where complex magnetic structures require numerical modeling. We show that in strong fields (>10 μT), a few thousand nanoscopic vortex-state particles can record TRM with less than 1% error, regardless of shape. For weaker fields, morphology plays a crucial role, with spherical and oblate particles performing best. These findings challenge assumptions about particle requirements for faithful TRM recording and highlight the influence of grain shape in paleomagnetic studies. Our results justify using smaller geological samples and magnetic microscopy to reconstruct ancient magnetic fields with precision.

    This came about from discussions between myself, Ricardo, Ualisson, and Gelson about deriving the number of particles that are needed to realistically recover the bias field of the Earth. The motivation was to provide a guideline for our magnetic microscopy work so we know how many measurements are needed to get a statistically reasonable estimate of the field. Ualisson took leadership of the project and produced this great bit of research.

    A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
    described challenges related to the development of research software and
    highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
    citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
    enables community-driven software review, publication, and
    citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
    project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
    publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
    platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
    pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
    approximately three years of existence.

    This correspondence was written by the editorial board of the
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> in
    response to the Nature Methods editorial
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x">"Giving Software its Due"</a>.
    It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a
    preprint instead.
