    Magmatic rocks record ambient magnetic fields during cooling, preserving them for billions of years through thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). TRM accuracy depends on particle size, shape, magnetic properties, and the number of particles available to record the field. While traditionally interpreted via Neél’s single-domain theory, most particles exist in a vortex state, where complex magnetic structures require numerical modeling. We show that in strong fields (>10 μT), a few thousand nanoscopic vortex-state particles can record TRM with less than 1% error, regardless of shape. For weaker fields, morphology plays a crucial role, with spherical and oblate particles performing best. These findings challenge assumptions about particle requirements for faithful TRM recording and highlight the influence of grain shape in paleomagnetic studies. Our results justify using smaller geological samples and magnetic microscopy to reconstruct ancient magnetic fields with precision.

    This came about from discussions between myself, Ricardo, Ualisson, and Gelson about deriving the number of particles that are needed to realistically recover the bias field of the Earth. The motivation was to provide a guideline for our magnetic microscopy work so we know how many measurements are needed to get a statistically reasonable estimate of the field. Ualisson took leadership of the project and produced this great bit of research.

    Earth scientists can estimate the depth of certain rocks beneath Earth's surface by measuring the small disturbances that they cause in the Earth's gravity and magnetic fields. A popular method for this is Euler deconvolution, which is widely available in geoscience software and can be run quickly on a standard computer. Unfortunately, Euler deconvolution has some shortcomings: 1) the approximate shape of the rocks must be known, for example, a sphere or a wide flat slab, represented by the structural index 2) the depth of the rocks is not well estimated when there is noise in our data, which is a common occurrence. We propose a new method, Euler inversion, which fixes some of the shortcomings of Euler deconvolution by using more adequate (and complex) mathematics. Our method is less sensitive to noise in the data and is also able to determine the approximate shape of the source (the structural index). Euler inversion is also fast to execute on a standard computer, making it a practical alternative to Euler deconvolution on an Earth scientists toolbox.

    The main idea for this paper came about during an potential-field methods class which Leo took in 2012 with his then PhD supervisor Prof. Valéria C. F. Barbosa. While learning about the Euler deconvolution method, which is a speciality of Valéria, Leo connected it with the geodetic network adjustment theory he had been taught by Prof. Spiros Pagiatakis during an exchange program at York University, Canada, in 2008. An initial prototype was developed in 2012 but there were still some rough edges and the project was shelved to make way for other more urgent projects at the time. Leo returned to this every few years, making slow progress, and involving Vanderlei in the planning and discussion of the theory. In 2024, co-authors Gelson, India, and Vanderlei joined Leo for a sprint to finish the method and produce this paper. The paper was submitted to Geophysical Journal International in December 2024.

    A recent editorial in Nature Methods, "Giving Software its Due",
    described challenges related to the development of research software and
    highlighted, in particular, the challenge of software publication and
    citation. Here, we call attention to a system that we have developed that
    enables community-driven software review, publication, and
    citation: The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open-source
    project and an open access journal that provides a light-weight
    publishing process for research software. Focused on and based in open
    platforms and on a community of contributors, JOSS evidently satisfies a
    pressing need, having already published more than 500 articles in
    approximately three years of existence.

    This correspondence was written by the editorial board of the
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a> in
    response to the Nature Methods editorial
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0350-x">"Giving Software its Due"</a>.
    It was not accepted as a comment on the editorial so we published it as a
    preprint instead.
