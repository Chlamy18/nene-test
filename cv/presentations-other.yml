    The <a target="_blank" href="https://prosper.liverpool.ac.uk/">Prosper
    project</a>, a multi-institution training project in the UK, hosts a series
    of online events called the "PI Network" which offers discussion and
    training for early career researchers. I was invited to be a panelist and
    presenter in this session about lab handbooks because of my work on the <a
    target="_blank" href="https://www.compgeolab.org/manual/">CompGeoLab
    manual</a>. It was a fun experience and I got to learn about other people
    who make these types of guides for their research groups.

    I had the pleasure of giving this talk to the SEG and EAGE Student
    Chapter of the Observatório Nacional (where I went to grad school). It
    was about my path through science and some tips for those wanting to go
    abroad. Slides and talk were in Portuguese.
