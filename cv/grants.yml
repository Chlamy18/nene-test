    The magnetization that is locked in certain minerals at the time of their
    formation is one of the few gateways we have to the Earth's distant past.
    By measuring the magnetization of certain rocks we are able to determine
    properties about the Earth's magnetic field in the past, which provides
    crucial information about our planet's climate history and the movement of
    the plates that make up the outermost layer of the Earth. For decades,
    researchers have only been able to make measurements of the average
    magnetic field of each rock sample, which can lead to large uncertainties
    in our estimates or even having to discard entire samples. Recent advances
    in technology are allowing us to make measurements in such detail that we
    may soon be able to distinguish the magnetic fields of the individual
    minerals that make up the rock sample. This new technology opens the door
    to using methods normally applied to national or continental scale
    geophysical surveys to micrometer scale data. There is still much to be
    explored and refined before this can be achieved. This collaboration will
    bring together experts from both large scale geophysics and micrometer
    scale paleomagnetism to explore the possibilities and help define future
    directions of research.
