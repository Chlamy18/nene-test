    After 2.5 years in Hawaiʻi, I was offered a position to join the Geophysics group
    of the University of Liverpool's
    <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/">Department
    of Earth, Ocean and Ecological Sciences</a>.
    This was an exciting opportunity to start my own research group and
    navigate the UK system, which was entirely new to me.

    After my initial leave from UERJ was done, I decided to quit that job and
    stay in Hawaiʻi a bit longer. I transitioned into this soft-money position
    to be able to apply for grants that could sustain myself and the GMT
    project beyond the funding we had available.

    This was a mix of a sabbatical from UERJ and a postdoc position. I took a
    leave of absence for 1 year to work with the Generic Mapping Tools team to
    create PyGMT, a widely-used Python library for processing and visualizing
    geophysical data.

    This was my first academic position, which I got while still working on my
    PhD thesis.
    It was a great opportunity to gain some experience,
    particularly in teaching, which turned out to be the thing I like the most
    about the job.
