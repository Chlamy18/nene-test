# About

This is an update on the progress we've made in [PyGMT](https://www.pygmt.org).
There are examples of some of the new features implemented by myself and
contributors, as well as the main problems we're facing and a call for
volunteers.

The main feedback we got during the meeting is that the API is not very
intuitive for people unfamiliar with GMT (which I expect to be the majority of
users). This has got me thinking of ways to move away from the direct mapping
of GMT modules to PyGMT functions. Instead, we should implement something that
makes sense in Python and call whatever GMT modules we need to get that done
under the hood.

# Abstract

For almost 30 years, the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) have provided the Earth,
Ocean, and Planetary Sciences with an open-source toolbox for processing and
visualizing spatial data (bathymetry, gravity, magnetic, earthquake focal
mechanisms, and more). In many fields, GMT is the de facto standard for
creating high-resolution publication quality maps, figures, and animations.
Since version 5, GMT has provided a C language Application Programming
Interface (API) that allows other programs to access its core functionality. We
are using this bridge to develop PyGMT ([www.pygmt.org](http://www.pygmt.org/);
formerly GMT/Python), an open-source library that allows users of the Python
programming language to leverage the almost thirty years of continuous GMT
development. PyGMT is designed to integrate with the existing scientific Python
ecosystem, including popular packages such as numpy, pandas, and xarray. PyGMT
integrates seamlessly with the Jupyter notebook, allowing high-quality figures
to be generated interactively both in a personal computer and in cloud
computing environments compatible with Jupyter. We will present the design and
usage of the software package, latest developments and updates, and lessons
learned during its implementation.
