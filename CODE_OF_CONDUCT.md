# Code of Conduct

All participants in this project, along with visitors and commenters, are
expected to abide by the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code
as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe
environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

The project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or
lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of anyone and in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any discussion.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of discussions, or unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

We expect participants to treat each other professionally with respect to their
work, with constructive criticism and without dismissive behavior.

## Reporting violations

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact [Leonardo Uieda](https://www.leouieda.com)
