# About

This is talk I've been working on and tweaking over a few months now. It's
about my path through geophysics and open-source software, how it's shaped my
research and teaching, what I see as the future of this area (with some tips
for informing yourself on current software best practices), and some of the
exciting research we're doing at the [Computer-Oriented Geoscience
Lab](https://www.compgeolab.org/).

The slides were made with
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) using my new talk template

There are links to the slides specific to each time a version of this talk was
given. The source code links contain the underlying HTML code of the slides.

This is the second version of this talk, delivered online. I changed it a bit
to reflect current research presented at [EGU2020][/talks/egu2020] and focus
less on the technical side of development. The online delivery was new to me
but it worked out well. Even though it can be strange to talk to a screen for
50 minutes, the great questions afterwards more than made up for it.

This is the first version of this talk, delivered at the GDSL group seminars.
It was about my path through geophysics guided by my interests in making
open-source software: how I got started with coding, the various projects I'm
developing, how that's shaped my research, and plans for the future.
